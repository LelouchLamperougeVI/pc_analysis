This folder contains a collection of improved built-in MATLAB functions.
These functions are aimed at improving performance and/or expending usability.
As a result, many are written in C/C++ or FORTRAN, and would need to be compiled before use.

Compiled mex files are usually accompanied by a MATLAB function prefixed by 'b'.
For example, the improved 'xcorr2' function is called 'bxcorr2', short for 'better xcorr2'.
